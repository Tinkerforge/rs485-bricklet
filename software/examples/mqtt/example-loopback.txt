# For this example connect the RX+/- pins to TX+/- pins on the same Bricklet
# and configure the DIP switch on the Bricklet to full-duplex mode

# Change XYZ to the UID of your RS485 Bricklet

setup:
	# Enable full-duplex mode
	publish '{"baudrate": 115200, "parity": "none", "stopbits": "1", "wordlength": "8", "duplex": "full"}' to tinkerforge/request/rs485_bricklet/XYZ/set_rs485_configuration

	# Handle incoming read callbacks
	subscribe to tinkerforge/callback/rs485_bricklet/XYZ/read # Received messages contain the message as string
	publish '{"register": true}' to tinkerforge/register/rs485_bricklet/XYZ/read # Register read callback

	# Enable read callback
	publish '' to tinkerforge/request/rs485_bricklet/XYZ/enable_read_callback

	# Send test message
	publish '{"message": "test"}' to tinkerforge/request/rs485_bricklet/XYZ/write
